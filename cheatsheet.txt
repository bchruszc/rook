# Brad has a terrible memory.  Some command line stuff that will help...

#
#  To update models
#

# Django ??? on Cloud9:
./manage.py schemamigration rookscore --auto
./manage.py migrate rookscore

# Django 1.7+ (webfaction)
python3.4 manage.py.bak makemigrations
python3.4 manage.py.bak migrate


# Updated django on cloud9:
sudo pip3 install -U Django
sudo pip3 install -U djangorestframework
sudo pip3 install -U markdown
sudo pip3 install -U django-filter
sudo pip3 install -U django-silk
sudo pip3 install django-cors-headers
#sudo pip3 install -U restless

So it would seem that we use restless for the actual API, but it doesn't support Django 1.8+
Will need to convert to djangorestframework
